In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence fluid
dynamics in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behaviour of these natural structures.

+ The climate
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
+ The topography
+ The geology

The flow rate of a glacier is
defined by the following equation:

$ Q = rho A v + C $
